# Master PRD Conformance Dashboard — Phase B/C

> **Author:** MAIN · **Status:** 🟡 **WORKING DRAFT (Phase B prep, authored Fri night).** Per-requirement BE/FE verdict cells marked ⏳ are GATED on BE+1 + FE+1 fresh conformance verdicts (Sat 10-11 AM). Decisions A-E, the surfaced conflicts, the wiring inventory, and the F18 build plan are CODE-GROUNDED + final.
> **Inputs read (Phase B prep):** BE+1 #264 PRD baseline · BE+1 #261 Day-32 audit (AMBER) · BE+1 fixes #262/#263 (open) · FE+1 `fri-fe-prd-baseline.md` + Thu full-audit · my Phase A baseline (`2026-06-12-fri-main-prd-orchestration-baseline.md`).
> **Contract:** PM1-mandated = MUST WORK. PM2-PM4-deferred = acceptable stub/canned. **Modified by Yogesh Decisions A-E (below) which reclassify several gaps.**

## §0 — Yogesh's 5 binding decisions (applied throughout)

| #        | Decision                                                                            | Conformance effect                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**    | Invite flow = **M1-MANDATED, must work for pilot**                                  | P0-D stays 🔴 must-fix (real Resend/Apps-Script invite + set-password)       |
| **B(a)** | TipTap doc authoring = **SKIP from pilot**                                          | **GAP-1 reclassifies 🔴→⚫ acceptable-deferral** (removes a ~1-2 week P0)    |
| **B(b)** | F18 Test Suites = **IN scope, BUILD before Yogesh tests**                           | GAP-2 = 🔴 must-**build** (fresh, ~1 week — see §2 conflict)                 |
| **C**    | F24 QA-Value dashboard = **DROPPED for pilot**                                      | **GAP-3 reclassifies 🟡→⚫** (F25 already shipped covers exec view)          |
| **D**    | Jira = **SEED-ONLY for pilot test; outbound sync = M5 hardening**                   | FR-013 Jira connect/sync 501-stubs = acceptable-for-pilot; outbound deferred |
| **E**    | P0-C fictional names = **canned-data override path** (NO Rule 3 locked-frame edits) | P0-C 🔴 fix via canned-data swap to Iksula canon, not HTML edits             |

**Net effect of A-E:** two big items removed from the blocker list (TipTap GAP-1, F24 GAP-3); F18 confirmed as a fresh build; the real-data P0 set sharpens to **P0-A/B/C/D + F18-build**.

## §2 — F18 Test Suites: CROSS-DOMAIN CONFLICT (surfaced, Rule 11) + build plan (Decision 2b)

**The conflict (must be reconciled by BE+1 at the Sat verdict):**

| Source                                | Claim                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BE Day-32 audit §2/§3 (#261)          | "F18 Suites — suites + members CRUD — ✅ **LIVE** — 5 real"                                                                                                                                       |

| **Independent grep (both worktrees)** | **0 hits** for `TestSuite` in `apps/api/src`; no controller/service/DTO/module; no FE `*suite*` route; only RLS policies reference `test_suites`. 5 rows may be seeded but **no API reads them.** |

**Code-grounded resolution: F18 must be built FRESH.** BE Day-32 over-claimed (the table is seeded + has RLS, but there is no CRUD surface). This mirrors the 33rd reality-check (BE catalog over-claim).

**Build plan (Decision 2b — IN scope, build before Yogesh tests):**

- **BE+1:** net-new `test-suites` controller + service + module + shared Zod schema + RBAC `@Roles` + audit writes + RLS already present. (`/api/projects/:projectId/test-suites` CRUD + `/members`.)
- **FE+1:** port `F18 Test Suites v2.html` + `F18m1 Edit Suite Modal v2.html` (canonical HTML ready) to React via frame-port skill; AdminShell wrap; canned-data extract.
- **Integration:** suite CRUD handshake + run-from-suite wire (W-002) + empty-states.
- **Effort:** **~1 week** (fresh build both sides). **Risk Yogesh should weigh now:** this is the single largest scope item and it gates "before Yogesh tests" — it likely sets the test-cycle start date.

**Sequencing seed:** F09 (~1-2hr) is the cheapest real-data win → do first. Then P0-A auth gate + P0-C canned→Iksula-canon (Dec E) + P0-D invite (Dec A). F18 (~1wk) runs parallel BE+FE. F27/F26/F25 Tier-2 ports batch (~1 day).

## §4 — BE fixes already in flight (reduce the blocker count)

- **#262 (OPEN, 60/60 + 701/701 green)** — fixes BE Day-32's **1 pre-launch P1** (unguarded `POST /api/defects/:id/rca` → `@Roles` + tenant isolation + real actor) **AND** the disabled-user P2 (`resolveSession` returns null when `disabledAt` set). Merging this clears the BE pre-launch P1.
- **#263 (OPEN, test-only)** — completes the `better-auth/plugins` mock factory in the day0 spec → closes the **last #259-class instance**. Safe.

Both off `cb1f2c4`, no conflicts. **Recommend merging both** (subject to your review) to shrink the Sat backlog — #262 especially (it's the BE pre-launch P1 fix).

---

## §5 — BE GREEN(AMBER) vs FE HARD-HOLD — reconciled

BE Day-32 = **AMBER (launch-viable, 1 pre-launch P1)**; FE Thu = **HARD-HOLD (4 P0, 24/28 canned)**. Both correct for their layer. **The binding reality for a _real-data_ pilot is FE's HARD-HOLD** — the app shows fiction + lacks the auth gate. BE capability is largely present; the work is FE wiring + auth-gate + role-routing + the F18 fresh build. **M5 hardening is FE-led, BE in support** (+ #262/#263 + F18 BE CRUD).

## §6 — Phase C placeholders (GATED — Sat 1 PM)

- **C1 scoreboard** ⏳ (🟢/🟡/🔴/⚫ per route, after fresh verdicts)
- **C2 sequence** ⏳ (hours-to-GREEN; F09 first → P0-A/C/D → F18 parallel → Tier-2 ports → integration smoke → Yogesh deep test)
- **C3 Akshay comms** ⏳ (drafted once launch date set; framing: thorough verification caught canned-vs-real before user exposure; pilot includes agentic-QA core + F18 + working admin/invite; excludes TipTap doc authoring + Jira outbound + F24)
- **My independent launch recommendation** ⏳ (Phase C, separate from BE+1/FE+1)

## §7 — B4/B5 reconciliation (started)

- **B4 safety-pattern ordinal:** `memory.md` feedback list = **15 distinct files** (count Sat to finalize) incl. the new metadata-audit pattern. Brief's "17th" ≠ repo's ~15. Canonical renumber Sat. _(metadata-audit pattern = the trigger of THIS whole audit.)_
- **B5 reality-checks:** ~38 this week (BE+1 carried; confirm tally from EODs Sat).

## §8 — Phase D close-out status

- **D1** ⏳ — rename `2026-06-12-fri-pilot-launch.md` → `yogesh-deep-test-cycle.md` (no fixed date); strip "GREEN GO". Do before #260 merge.
- **D2** ✅ **RESOLVED by Yogesh** — `chat-history/` is outside-repo → never pushed → token-in-transcript not a leak risk. No scrub needed; archive stays local-only.
- **D3** ⏳ — 6 schema acks surfaced when Yogesh ready (deferred Sat AM).

_Phase B working draft authored Fri night 2026-06-11. Verdict cells gated on Sat BE+1/FE+1 inputs. Decisions A-E applied; F18 conflict + wiring inventory code-grounded; every finding cited (Rule 17 spirit). The F18 BE-claims-LIVE vs code-says-NOT-BUILT conflict is surfaced for Yogesh + BE+1 reconciliation, not resolved by MAIN._
