# Project Memory Index

Auto-loaded by `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/inject-memory.sh` before every tool
call. This file is the single source of truth for what's worth remembering
across sessions, machines, and contributors. It travels with the repo.

Distinct from user-session memory at `~/.claude/projects/<repo>/memory/` which
is private to a specific machine and Claude Code install.

## Files

**Top-level (loaded by `inject-memory.sh` for every tool call):**

- @.claude/memory/general.md — project identity, 8-user roster, $0 cost gate, locked stack, M0–M6 plan, risky assumptions to watch

**Decision + learnings (added 2026-04-28, skill v1.3 memory system batch):**

- @.claude/memory/CLAUDE_DECISIONS.md — architectural decisions tied to ADRs (loaded when editing related code paths)
- @.claude/memory/STACK_LEARNINGS.md — gotchas like the zod/resolvers v3 lockstep, hook flag-boundary regex, Next.js static-export root redirect
- @.claude/memory/IKSULA_CONTEXT.md — pilot team (8 named users), anchor project (RET), ID patterns, sample files — loaded before seed/fixture/demo writes
- @.claude/memory/PM1_PATTERNS.md — Pattern A deferred routing, Rule 13 visual confirmation gate, Rule 12 RWD enforcement, audit log requirement, shared-schema discipline

**Domain (per-area deep dives):**

- @.claude/memory/domain/architecture.md — RWD rule, two-panel auth pattern, static-export trade-offs, design-token discipline, frame-port protocol
- @.claude/memory/domain/bugs.md — bug patterns + fixes (Next 16 slip, Grammarly hydration, Bash sub-shell PATH, commitlint type-enum)
- @.claude/memory/domain/api.md — API design decisions (stub until MS0-T020 lands the first endpoints)

**Tools (per-tool gotchas):**

- @.claude/memory/tools/database.md — Postgres 15 + pgvector on Neon free, Prisma 5, HNSW indexes
- @.claude/memory/tools/stack.md — Homebrew at non-standard path, two GitHub accounts, husky 9, pnpm 10.33.2, Node v24

**Feedback — first-use + session-lesson journals (referenced on demand, not auto-loaded):**

- @.claude/memory/feedback_ac042_provenance_llm_assist.md — AC042 corpus used Codex-labeled + human-spot-checked ground truth (ADR-022 §5.9 reserve precedent); M6 corpus-governance follow-up (Day-28)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_eval_gate_smoke_first.md — run a 1-defect smoke before the full binding eval; schema-bridge failures present as a zero-hypothesis degraded state (Day-28)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_skill_v2.2_first_use.md — frame-port skill v2.2 first-use journal (FE F22 Day-22/23 + BE M5-close footnote Day-28)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_worktree_locked_merge_pattern.md — merging a PR whose branch is checked out in a sibling worktree: temp-branch + --force-with-lease to the remote ref; union-resolve add/add conflicts (pilot Day-2 AM)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_multi_worktree_env_discipline.md — BINDING: .env edits MUST target the correct worktree (-backend/-frontend/root); verify with pwd + awk before assuming landed (Day-2 PM, 18th reality-check)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_chained_base_cascade_resolution.md — BINDING: when squash-merge causes downstream PRs to go DIRTY, use temp-branch + rebase + take-ours for upstream content + force-push (Day-3 AM, 4-PR merge wave)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_dns_authority_verify_day_1.md — BINDING: Day-1 of any project, verify DNS edit access on the production domain explicitly. Domain ownership ≠ email account ownership ≠ DNS edit access. Drove ADR-025 Apps Script pivot (Sat Day-3+4 AM, Iksula IT blocker discovery)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_multi_worktree_chat_misroute.md — BINDING: agents MUST verify-before-edit when an incoming brief looks outside their worktree's role (check pwd + file paths + intent). Sat Day-3+4 ~12:15 IST, BE+1 25th reality-check, F26m1 brief misroute caught clean
- @.claude/memory/feedback_multi_worktree_git_working_tree_drift.md — BINDING: cross-worktree .git sharing causes locked-frame `D` status drift. Mitigation: explicit-path `git add` + `git restore` + branch creation with `origin/main` explicit. Sat Day-3+4 BE+1 26th reality-check + MAIN replay + branch-creation drift
- @.claude/memory/feedback_stale_deploy_diagnosis_pattern.md — BINDING: before classifying any UI bug as P0/P1 against a deployed environment, verify which commit/PR the deploy is built from. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys on `main` only; pending PRs are NOT in the bundle. Grep current main + read source before code surgery. Sun Day-5 ~16:35 IST after FE+1's 32nd reality-check caught P0-001 as stale-deploy, not code bug. Includes stacked-PR cascade caveat (#250 auto-closed on parent merge → #251 re-open)
- @.claude/memory/feedback_verify_api_paths_before_consumer_wiring.md — BINDING: never prescribe API paths/shapes to a consumer agent without first verifying against producer source (apps/api/src/<resource>/\*.controller.ts + DTOs + packages/shared/src/schemas/). Sun Day-5 ~17:00 IST after BE+1's 33rd reality-check caught 5 errors in MAIN's prescribed Option B endpoint catalog before FE+1 wired blind
- @.claude/memory/feedback_independent_diagnosis_convergence.md — BINDING: when two independent agents arrive at the same root cause through different investigation paths, treat the diagnosis as high-confidence. Trust the convergence; act on it without redundant verification. Sun Day-5 ~18:00 IST after BE+1 (35th RC, traced infra) + FE+1 (34th RC, traced code) converged on P0-001 cross-layer root cause (cookie infra + persona embed). Yogesh approved Option A on the convergence signal alone
- @.claude/memory/feedback_p0_001_closure_cascade.md — BINDING: cross-site auth-identity bugs on split deploys need 3 coordinated layers (BE cookie/CORS infra + FE session-wire + BE customSession app-fields from the separate TB-002 users table); verify END state in fresh incognito not layer merges. Also: a `jest.mock(module, factory)` factory must export EVERY symbol the unit imports — an omitted export becomes `undefined` and presents as "X is not a function" (mis-readable as ESM/CJS interop). P0-001 closed + verified Thu Jun 11 4:16 PM IST (#256+#258+#259); BE+1 36th RC
- @.claude/memory/feedback_metadata_audit_reveals_artifact_issues.md — BINDING: when the user questions metadata (stale tracking files, log gaps, odd names, dates, counts), treat it as a trigger for a focused audit of the underlying artifact — NOT a bookkeeping chore. If fixing the metadata would require inventing data, that need-to-invent is itself the integrity-gap signal. Thu Jun 11: Yogesh's Excel-staleness question → MAIN principled stop → BE+1 Day-32 + FE+1 audits → 3 P0 launch-blockers caught before user exposure (Fri launch HELD). Ordinal ("17th") flagged for reconciliation in NEW MANDATE Phase B3
- @.claude/memory/feedback_deployed_bundle_baseurl_verification.md — BINDING: a cross-origin-API FE deploy is NOT "live-verified" until a human watches DevTools Network on the LIVE URL and confirms outgoing requests hit the production API origin with 2xx. Route mocks + CI green + curl-the-API + Playwright-pass are all insufficient — Pattern A canned fallback masks a bundle silently calling localhost:3001 (build-env NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL gap inlines the dev default at build time; one Cloudflare Pages env var + rebuild fixes every getApiBaseURL() consumer at once). Fri Jun 12 46th RC: Yogesh's 30-min network-tab click caught what 10 auditors + the whole verification stack missed
- @.claude/memory/feedback_verify_constraint_scope_before_expensive_workaround.md — **49th RC (canonical, Yogesh ruling Thu Jun 18 PM).** BINDING: when an external constraint (quota / rate limit / feature gate / tier cutoff) blocks your plan, verify its EXACT scope (per-account vs per-project vs per-region vs per-call) from primary vendor docs BEFORE proposing an expensive workaround. The cheap same-vendor alternative often lives in the unread next paragraph. Thu Jun 18: Yogesh's "why Supabase?" → re-reading Neon docs → 100 CU-hr cap is per-project not per-account → Path C = 2nd Neon project qa-nexus-2 ($0, ~1 hr) beats Supabase migration (3-4 hr, new vendor). #285 Supabase plan closed; reframed as recoverable-via-git-history fallback.
- @.claude/memory/feedback_institutional_memory_survives_in_vcs.md — **50th RC (per Yogesh ruling Thu Jun 18 PM — renumbered from 49th candidate).** BINDING: institutional memory must live in version control + off-device backup, never only in agent process state. Before any laptop/account/email rotation: anything that matters must be in (a) the cloned repo OR (b) an off-device copy of local-only stores (user auto-memory, Cowork workspace, chat-history). "The next session will remember" = lost. Thu Jun 18 prep for Sun Jun 21 transition → master handoff `docs/handoff/2026-06-21-laptop-transition-master-handoff.md` is the surviving brain.
- @.claude/memory/feedback_env_no_stale_no_duplicates_before_migration.md — **51st RC (banked by BE+1 Thu Jun 18 evening).** BINDING: before any same-vendor env migration (Neon project → Neon project, Render service → Render service, S3 bucket → S3 bucket — ANY URL-tier env swap), audit every `.env` / `.env.local` / Render env / GitHub Secrets store for BOTH (a) stale references to the OLD environment AND (b) duplicate keys — both checks together, not one. Same-vendor migrations are the highest-risk class because URL host/format looks "right enough" that grep-by-vendor misses stale values. Duplicate keys resolve runner-differently (dotenv last-wins; some shells first-wins; Render UI dedupes), so a dup silently makes migration-tool ↔ runtime-app diverge. Thu Jun 18: BE+1 caught stale OLD qa-nexus DATABASE_URL + duplicate DIRECT_URL in local .env BEFORE running `prisma migrate deploy` against qa-nexus-2 — caught-not-shipped, would have either mutated the wrong DB or silently misconfigured runtime.
- @.claude/memory/feedback_migrate_status_vs_schema_drift.md — **53rd RC (banked Fri Jun 19).** BINDING: `prisma migrate status` "up to date" only means migration FILES applied, NOT that the DB matches schema.prisma. `db push` changes never captured as migrations leave fresh DBs silently behind. Detect with `prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datasource --to-schema-datamodel --exit-code` (exit 2 = drift). Fix with idempotent corrective migration (IF NOT EXISTS everywhere). Day-32 qa-nexus-2: chain was 3 tables + 17 cols behind. Cross-ref: [[feedback_audit_immutability_and_seed_drift]], [[feedback_env_no_stale_no_duplicates_before_migration]].
- (user auto-memory) `feedback_hard_rule_11_verify_contract_before_consume.md` — **54th RC (banked Fri Jun 19).** BINDING: before wiring a FE consumer to a BE endpoint, grep the producer controller for the exact HTTP method + route. FE+1's pre-wire grep of `test-runs.controller.ts` found NO `@Get()` list endpoint — only `@Patch()` handlers (start/abort/report). Saved ~30 min dead-end wiring; ACTIVE_RUNS + RECENT_RUNS → `<ComingSoon>` stubs. Hard Rule 11 in production at the FE agent level. Lineage: 33rd RC [[feedback_verify_api_paths_before_consumer_wiring]] → 44th RC [[feedback_bank_the_blocked_window_with_stable_deliverable]] → **54th RC**.
- (user auto-memory) `feedback_agent_lane_discipline_flag_cross_domain.md` — **55th RC (banked Fri Jun 19 evening).** BINDING: when a task hits the wrong agent's lane (FE work routed to BE+1), flag cross-domain hazards (design-token hooks, branch collision, visual gate bypass) rather than silently execute. Surface to Yogesh + stand down on cross-lane item, continue in-lane work. BE+1 correctly refused ACTIVE_RUNS wire → deferred to Sat AM FE+1 warm-up (~15 min). Lineage: 25th RC [[feedback_multi_worktree_chat_misroute]] → **55th RC**.

## Maintenance

Run `/reorganize-memory` when any file exceeds 200 lines.

Run `/compound-learnings` at the end of every feature to append a one-line entry to `general.md` (the lightweight, every-session capture).

The 4 v1.3 files (CLAUDE_DECISIONS, STACK_LEARNINGS, IKSULA_CONTEXT, PM1_PATTERNS) are **maintained manually** — they're curated decision/pattern logs, not auto-appended. New entries land via direct edit when an ADR is accepted, a gotcha is diagnosed, the pilot team changes, or a new pattern is codified. The retro-agent can propose entries; Yogesh approves before they land.

Established 2026-04-27 per skill alignment audit P0.1. Expanded 2026-04-28 (Day 2 Block 3) per Tech-project-forge skill v1.3 memory-system spec.
